# finStruct

The finStruct library provides an environment for functional structures such as used in quantitative finance (curves, surfaces and boxes) as well as more general implementation.
The most important features are diverse ways of interpolation and bootstrapping said structures.
Concretely, it is applied for generating term structures and volatility surfaces in a research environment.
