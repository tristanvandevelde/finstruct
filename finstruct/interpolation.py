Implement Univariate and Multivariate (Spatial) interpolation. 
Should both be able to be implemented for all structures.
This means: a multivariate structure can use univariate interpolation if it specifies along which axes.
And also: a univariate structure can use multivariate interpolation, should mathematically reduce to the univariate case.
